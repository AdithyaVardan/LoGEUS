# LoGEUS - Logic GATES EMULATING SYSTEM
    This program is written to simulate the logic behind the 
    logic gates used in digital electronic circuits
    
    Since being the first iteration this program is going to 
    concentrate on the Basic gates 
    The basic gates included in the program are:-
    -AND
    -OR
    -NOT
